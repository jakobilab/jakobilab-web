The [University of Arizona Health Sciences Career Development Awards](https://healthsciences.arizona.edu/connect/announcements/uahs-2023-career-development-award) program recently selected Tobias as one of its five 2023 recipients.

Our lab will investigate the potential of this circRNA as a signature molecule, or a biomarker, which can be used to help physicians monitor the presence or progression of atrial fibrillation from a single blood sample. This new circRNA-based biomarker may provide us with a non-invasive and efficient way to detect atrial fibrillation early and potentially develop personalized therapies tailored to an individualâ€™s unique genetic profile.
