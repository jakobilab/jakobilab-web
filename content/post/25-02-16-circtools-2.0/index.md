We are proud to release circtools 2.0 on [GitHub](https://github.com/jakobilab/circtools/releases/tag/v2.0) and the accompanying paper on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.16.638209v1) in collaboration with the [Dieterich Lab](https://dieterichlab.org/).

Circtools 2.0 features 4 completely new modules for computational circular RNA research:

* **conservation module**: enables users to perform circRNA conservation analysis in five widely studied animal model species: mouse, human, rat, pig, and dog.
* **padlock probe design**: a specialized primer design tool tailored specifically for next-generation spatial transcriptomics technology.
* **nanopore module**: requires sequencing reads that have been produced using the protocol outlined in [Rahimi et al. (2021) ](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24975-z) and enables full-length circRNA detection.
* **metatool module**: offers integration of circularRNA predictions from CIRIquant to boost recall rates for circRNA detection.
