A new, large-scale circRNA detection benchmarking studies has just been published in [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01944-6), including our [circtools](https://github.com/jakobilab/circtools/) circRNA detection suite. The study is the largest to date including 16 circRNA detection tools. The paper is a very good read for everyone interested in optimizing circRNA detection accuracy and efficacy.
