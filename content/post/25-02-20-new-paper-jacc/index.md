Tobias' invited editorial "[Translating Translation: Protein-Coding CircRNAs as Potential Therapeutical Targets in Coronary Artery Disease](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacbts.2024.10.011)" in *JACC: Basic to Translational Science*  has been published! The editorial comments on the recent study "[CircBTBD7-420aa Encoded by hsa_circ_0000563 Regulates the Progression of Atherosclerosis and Construction of circBTBD7-420aa Engineered Exosomes](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacbts.2024.09.003)" by Gan et al. and highlights the translation of circBTBD7 into a functional peptide that can regulate the progression of atherosclerosis. The editorial also discusses techniques and approaches required to validate translation of circRNAs based on computational predictions.
