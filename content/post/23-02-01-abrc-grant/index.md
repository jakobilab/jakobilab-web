The lab received a research grant from the [Arizona Biomedical Research Centre](https://www.azdhs.gov/biomedical/#research-grants) to examine the roles of different Ribonucleic acid (RNA) species in cardiovascular diseases. In our quest to find novel RNAs for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes the lab will also continue to work on the development of computational methods that can be used by other researchers with the goal of identifying diseases as early as possible.

Our lab was one of eight from the college to be awarded a grant by the Arizona Department of Health Services, Arizona Biomedical Research Commission. In total, $2.8 million in grants were awarded over a three-year period.
