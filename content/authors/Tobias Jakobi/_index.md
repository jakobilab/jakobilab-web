Dr. Jakobi is bioinformatician trained with an emphasis on the interconnection 
of wet lab research and computational research. His academic and research 
training included eukaryotic biology, genome research, and wet lab training in addition
to comprehensive training in theoretical and applied bioinformatics to allow the
fluent communication between wet lab and bioinformatics.

I am working as Assistant Professor in the [Department of Internal Medicine](https://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/medicine) and in the new [Translational Cardiovascular Research Center (TCRC)](https://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/tcrc) at [The University of Arizona College of Medicine – Phoenix](https://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/)
