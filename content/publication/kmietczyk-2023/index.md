abstract: m6A mRNA methylation controls cardiomyocyte function and increased overall
  m6A levels are a stereotyping finding in heart failure independent of the underlying
  etiology. However, it is largely unknown how the information is read by m6A reader
  proteins in heart failure. Here we show that the m6A reader protein Ythdf2 controls
  cardiac function and identified a novel mechanism how reader proteins control gene
  expression and cardiac function. Deletion of Ythdf2 in cardiomyocytes in vivo leads
  to mild cardiac hypertrophy, reduced heart function, and increased fibrosis during
  pressure overload as well as during aging. Similarly, in vitro the knockdown of
  Ythdf2 results in cardiomyocyte growth and remodeling. Mechanistically, we identified
  the eucaryotic elongation factor 2 as post-transcriptionally regulated by Ythdf2
  using cell type specific Ribo-seq data. Our study expands our understanding on the
  regulatory functions of m6A methylation in cardiomyocytes and how cardiac function
  is controlled by the m6A reader protein Ythdf2.
