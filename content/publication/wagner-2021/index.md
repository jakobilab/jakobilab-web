abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spawned a global health crisis in late
  2019 and is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection can
  lead to elevated markers of endothelial dysfunction associated with higher risk
  of mortality. It is unclear whether endothelial dysfunction is caused by direct
  infection of endothelial cells or is mainly secondary to inflammation. Here, we
  investigate whether different types of endothelial cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
  Human endothelial cells from different vascular beds including umbilical vein endothelial
  cells, coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), cardiac and lung microvascular
  endothelial cells, or pulmonary arterial cells were inoculated in vitro with SARS-CoV-2.
  Viral spike protein was only detected in HCAECs after SARS-CoV-2 infection but not
  in the other endothelial cells tested. Consistently, only HCAEC expressed the SARS-CoV-2
  receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), required for virus infection. Infection
  with the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.2 resulted in significantly
  higher levels of viral spike protein. Despite this, no intracellular double-stranded
  viral RNA was detected and the supernatant did not contain infectious virus. Analysis
  of the cellular distribution of the spike protein revealed that it co-localized
  with endosomal calnexin. SARS-CoV-2 infection did induce the ER stress gene EDEM1,
  which is responsible for clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER. Whereas the
  wild type of SARS-CoV-2 did not induce cytotoxic or pro-inflammatory effects, the
  variant B.1.1.7 reduced the HCAEC cell number. Of the different tested endothelial
  cells, HCAECs showed highest viral uptake but did not promote virus replication.
  Effects on cell number were only observed after infection with the variant B.1.1.7,
  suggesting that endothelial protection may be particularly important in patients
  infected with this variant.
