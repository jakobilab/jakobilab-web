abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are types of RNA molecules that have been discovered
  relatively recently and have been found to be widely expressed in eukaryotic cells.
  Unlike canonical linear RNA molecules, circRNAs form a covalently closed continuous
  loop structure without a 5′ or 3′ end. They are generated by a process called back-splicing,
  in which a downstream splice donor site is joined to an upstream splice acceptor
  site. CircRNAs have been found to play important roles in various biological processes,
  including gene regulation, alternative splicing, and protein translation. They can
  act as sponges for microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins and can also encode peptides
  or proteins. Additionally, circRNAs have been implicated in several diseases, including
  cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.
