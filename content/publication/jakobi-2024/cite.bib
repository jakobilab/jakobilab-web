 abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are types of RNA molecules that have been discovered relatively recently and have been found to be widely expressed in eukaryotic cells. Unlike canonical linear RNA molecules, circRNAs form a covalently closed continuous loop structure without a 5′ or 3′ end. They are generated by a process called back-splicing, in which a downstream splice donor site is joined to an upstream splice acceptor site. CircRNAs have been found to play important roles in various biological processes, including gene regulation, alternative splicing, and protein translation. They can act as sponges for microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins and can also encode peptides or proteins. Additionally, circRNAs have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.},
