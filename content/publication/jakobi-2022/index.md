  <sec>Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,
  placing unprecedented pressure on healthcare. Cardiomyopathy is described in patients
  with severe COVID-19 and increasing evidence suggests that cardiovascular involvement
  portends a high mortality. To facilitate fast development of antiviral interventions,
  drugs initially developed to treat other diseases are currently being repurposed
  as COVID-19 treatments. While it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 invades cells through
  the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2), the effect of drugs currently
  repurposed to treat COVID-19 on the heart requires further investigation.</sec><sec></br>
 
  Methods: Human
  induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were treated
  with five repurposed drugs (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir/interferon
  beta (INF-β), hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine) and compared with DMSO controls.
  Transcriptional profiling was performed to identify global changes in gene expression
  programs.</sec></br>

  <sec>Results: RNA sequencing of hiPSC-CMs revealed significant changes
  in gene programs related to calcium handling and the endoplasmic reticulum stress
  response, most prominently for lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir/interferon-beta.
  The results of the differential gene expression analysis are available for interactive
  access at https://covid19drugs.jakobilab.org.</sec><sec></br>Conclusion: Transcriptional
  profiling in hiPSC-CMs treated with COVID-19 drugs identified unfavorable changes
  with lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir/INF-β in key cardiac gene programs
  that may negatively affect heart function.</sec>
