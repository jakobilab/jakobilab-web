abstract: The detection of circular RNA molecules (circRNAs) is typically based on
  short-read RNA sequencing data processed using computational tools. Numerous such
  tools have been developed, but a systematic comparison with orthogonal validation
  is missing. Here, we set up a circRNA detection tool benchmarking study, in which
  16 tools detected more than 315,000 unique circRNAs in three deeply sequenced human
  cell types. Next, 1,516 predicted circRNAs were validated using three orthogonal
  methods. Generally, tool-specific precision is high and similar (median of 98.8%,
  96.3% and 95.5% for qPCR, RNase R and amplicon sequencing, respectively) whereas
  the sensitivity and number of predicted circRNAs (ranging from 1,372 to 58,032)
  are the most significant differentiators. Of note, precision values are lower when
  evaluating low-abundance circRNAs. We also show that the tools can be used complementarily
  to increase detection sensitivity. Finally, we offer recommendations for future
  circRNA detection and validation.
