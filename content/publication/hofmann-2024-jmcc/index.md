abstract: Cardiomyocytes activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) transcription
  factor ATF6 during pressure overload-induced hypertrophic growth. The UPR is thought
  to increase ER protein folding capacity and maintain proteostasis. ATF6 deficiency
  during pressure overload leads to heart failure, suggesting that ATF6 protects against
  myocardial dysfunction by preventing protein misfolding. However, conclusive evidence
  that ATF6 prevents toxic protein misfolding during cardiac hypertrophy is still
  pending. Here, we found that activation of the UPR, including ATF6, is a common
  response to pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mice. ATF6 KO mice failed to induce
  sufficient levels of UPR target genes in response to chronic isoproterenol infusion
  or transverse aortic constriction (TAC), resulting in impaired cardiac growth. To
  investigate the effects of ATF6 on protein folding, the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated
  proteins as well as soluble amyloid oligomers were directly quantified in hypertrophied
  hearts of WT and ATF6 KO mice. Whereas only low levels of protein misfolding was
  observed in WT hearts after TAC, ATF6 KO mice accumulated increased quantities of
  misfolded protein, which was associated with impaired myocardial function. Collectively,
  the data suggest that ATF6 plays a critical adaptive role during cardiac hypertrophy
  by protecting against protein misfolding.
